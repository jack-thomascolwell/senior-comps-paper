# Web Interface for Angular Overlap Model Calculations
The purpose of this project is to create an accesible computational package to run angular overlap model calculations. This model is of particlar interest for research and teaching purposes within inorganic chemistry. An accompanying problem set is included in the website. The code and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/jack-thomascolwell/senior-comps-code).
